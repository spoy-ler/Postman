# Postman
The purpose of the task is creating the collection of requests for the RESTful API with basic methods: 
1) <b>GET:</b> Retrieve data from a server.
2) <b>POST:</b>: Submit data to create or update a resource.
3) <b>PUT:</b> Update or replace an existing resource.
4) <b>PATCH:</b> Partially update an existing resource.
5) <b>DELETE:</b> Delete a specified resource.

The repository also contains documentation for the used API which consists of the description of API fields and possible values of these fields. 
[Link with documentation](https://github.com/spoy-ler/Postman/blob/main/documentation.pdf).

Valid and invalid checks have been implemented for the fields. Queries are developed in such a way that the collection can be launched. This is done through the use of variables. Also, at least 2 tests are written for each query.
